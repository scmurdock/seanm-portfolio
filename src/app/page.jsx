          'In this project, students are tasked with developing a portfolio website using Next.js and TailwindCSS, guided by a specific Figma design. The assignment begins with preparatory steps like familiarizing with relevant documentation and setting up the development environment, including Git configurations. The core objective is to craft a responsive webpage that accurately reflects the Figma layout, leveraging TailwindCSS for styling. Additional challenges include implementing a theme switcher for extra credit. Students will demonstrate their proficiency by organizing clean, well-documented code and committing their work to GitHub, with evaluation criteria focusing on layout accuracy, responsiveness, and coding practices.'
